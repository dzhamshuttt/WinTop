# WinTop
this is an open source program written in python, more precisely it is a custom task manager like process hacker and htop

the program was made in several days in python I will tell you a little about the process of creating this program to create it I needed the psutil library to be honest I used a neural network and then for more than 2 days I changed the variables of the expansion of the number of calculations I changed the interface in the code I also used different forums of python programmers and finally I created it well of course not myself but the program is open source
