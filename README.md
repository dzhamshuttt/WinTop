this is an open source program written in python, more precisely it is a custom task manager like process hacker and htop
*
the program was made in several days in python I will tell you a little about the process of creating this program
to create it I needed the psutil library to be honest I used a neural network
and then for more than 2 days I changed the variables of the expansion of the number
of calculations I changed the interface in the code I also used different forums of python programmers 
and finally I created it well of course not myself but the program is open source
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the program has a simple terminal interface
there are not as many colors as I would like but now I will tell you how this program was created I wanted to practice on python
I wrote simple terminal commands on different python libraries and came to the choice of psutil
I understood that I wouldn't be able to create such a complex program on my own because I'm only a beginner in Python and I can write simple projects and slightly complex ones
I asked a neural network (I won't say which one) write a task manager so that it opens on Python, part of the code, and I'll finish it and continue
and then I started to persistently correct the neural network code, change the interface manually, change variables, different numbers, colors, cross
then I tried to ask for help on different programmer forums so that they would contribute their bit but no one answered me and I realized that I was my own developer and then I started to correct the program then I used YouTube on how to improve the code and all that stuff
Well, today I started uploading my repository to the vastness of GitHub
I embellished it even better, packed it into an installer, and now I am writing this read me file

я опубликую файл rar что бы вам было проще разобраться в моей программе
всем досвидания by Dzhamshuttt
